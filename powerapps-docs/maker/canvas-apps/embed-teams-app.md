# Embed a PowerApps app in Teams 

You can share a PowerApps you've created by embedding it directly into Microsoft Teams. When completed, users can select **+** to add your app to any of **your** team channels or conversations in the team you are in. The app appears as a tile under **Tabs for your team**. 

An admin can upload the app so it shows up for **all** teams in your tenant under the **All tabs section**. See [Share an app in Microsoft Teams](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/embed-app-teams?branch=JimHoltzWorkBranch).

> [!NOTE]
> Team custom app policies must be set to allow uploading custom apps. If unable to embed your app in Teams, check with your administrator to see if they've setup [custom app settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/teams-custom-app-policies-and-settings#custom-app-policy-and-settings). 

## Prerequisites

- [Have a PowerApps license](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/pricing-billing-skus)
- Created a canvas app

## Locate your PowerApp's GUID

Find and make note of your PowerApp's GUID to use in a later step.

1. Sign in to [https://web.powerapps.com](https://web.powerapps.com), and then select **Apps** in the menu.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Show list of apps](./media/embed-teams-app/file-apps2.png "Show list of apps")

2. Select **More Commands** (...) for the app you want to share in Teams, and then select **Details**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![App details](./media/embed-teams-app/app-details.png "App details")

3. Record the **App ID** for later use.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![App details](./media/embed-teams-app/app-details2.png "App details")

## Install App Studio

You can skip these steps if App Studio is already installed. 

1. In Teams, select **Apps** in the lower-left of the Teams menu (![Apps icon](./media/embed-teams-app/apps-icon.png "Apps icon")).

2. Search for "App Studio" in the search box and then select it.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![App Studio](./media/embed-teams-app/store-app-studio.png "App Studio")

3. Select **Install**. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Install App Studio](./media/embed-teams-app/install-app-studio.png "Install App Studio")

4. Select **Open** for the App feature.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Open App Studio](./media/embed-teams-app/open-app-studio.png "Open App Studio")

## Create a Teams app for your PowerApp

1. In Teams, open App Studio.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Open App Studio](./media/embed-teams-app/open-app-studio2.png "Open App Studio")

2. Select the **Manifest editor** tab, and then select **Create a new app** under Welcome.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Create new app](./media/embed-teams-app/create-new-app.png "Create new app")

3. Fill in information about your app in the **App Details** page.  For the App ID GUID, you should use your PowerApp's App ID GUID you recorded above.  This will avoid duplication of Teams apps for a particular PowerApp.
